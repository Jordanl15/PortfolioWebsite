        <h2>UWP Chess Game</h2>
        <p>
            This .NET web application was developed using C#, the MVC design pattern, and an SQLite database to provide a robust and efficient solution for managing client projects. It features an intuitive interface that allows users to track item costs, maintain inventory, and view detailed project information. The application incorporates role-based access control, ensuring that users only have access to functionality aligned with their roles, such as administrators, managers, or standard users. Each role has specific permissions, enhancing both security and usability.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional features include dynamic reporting tools for project analysis and cost management, along with user-friendly forms for adding, updating, and managing data. The SQLite database ensures lightweight and efficient storage, making the application suitable for small to medium-sized businesses.
