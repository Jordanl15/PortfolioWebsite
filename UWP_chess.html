        <h2>UWP Chess Game</h2>
        <p>
            I developed this Chess game using pure C# without relying on any external libraries. The game is built as a Universal Windows Application (UWP), offering a seamless experience on Windows devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game features logic that tracks the score whenever a piece is captured, ensuring that the game is always up to date. It also prevents illegal moves and checks for checkmate, maintaining the integrity of the game. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A unique feature of this game is the customization options in the "Settings" page. Users can personalize the chessboard by selecting two colors: one for one set of tiles and another for the other set. Once you've made your selections, simply save the changes and apply them to update the board.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game then returns to the board view, ready for play with the newly selected tile colors.

                    When the game begins, the white pieces always make the first move. Once white has moved, it becomes black's turn. The game alternates turns in this manner throughout.

                    Each chess piece is restricted to its legal moves based on traditional chess rules. You can only move a piece to valid positions on the board.
